TARTUP SEQUENCE
1. Make SET EPOCH CurrentServerTimestamp NX (In seconds)
2. If return is nil then make GET EPOCH and cache local

WRITE SEQUENCE
1. Arrange Data into partitions <TagName>-<PartitionStart> 
2. Each partition should have MEMBER which is value appended with CurrentServerTimestamp & SCORE which is relative to partition start.
3. Make a bulk ZADD Redis command
4. Make a ZADD command with KEY as TagName SCORE as (EPOCH-PartitionStart) and MEMBER as <TagName>-<PartitionStart> (This is Index for Read)
5. Make a ZADD command with "RecentActivity" KEY and MEMBER as partitionName and SCORE as EPOCH-CurrentServerTimestamp(This is so that we have SCORE within numerical limit of long)(This is for Oldest partition updated)

READ SEQUENCE
1. For each tagname convert StartTime to (EPOCH-StartPartitionTime) with the same PartitionStart formulae & EndTime=(EPOCH-EndTime).
2. Make ZRANGEBYSCORE command with Tagname StartPartitionTime & EndTime
3. This should return all the partitions needed to be scanned.
4. Use ZRANGEBYSCORE on each of them to collect the results.
5. Adjust for Update scenario with CurrentServerTimestamp

UPDATE SEQUENCE
Same as the write sequence, This will add a duplicate score in the partition which can identified by taking latest CurrentServerTimestamp from MEMBER.

DELETE SEQUENCE
??? Maybe add a DELETED as payload just as update ???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENQUEUEPURGE SEQUENCE  (background thread timed every hour)
Should be in a transaction redis script.
1. Make ZRANGE  RecentActivity -1 -1 WITHSCORES
2. Add SCORE with EPOCH
3. Subtract it with Current Timestamp and see if its > DeadThreshold time.
4. If yes then read all from the sorted set  Make XADD Purge * FIELD as Keyname & STRING as serialized entries. 

PURGEACK SEQUENCE (input will be the id for stream)
Should be in a transaction redis script.
1. XRANGE purge ID ID deserialize entries & make ZREM Field entries
2. Make !EXISTS Field then ZREM Tag Field (Index Entries) & ZREM RecentActivity
3. XACK ID
4. XDEL ID

Need to have Tag name and tagname partition name.
